# Multi_Class_Cardiac_Arrhythmia

The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it in one of the 16 groups. Class 01 refers to 'normal' ECG classes 02 to 15
refers to different classes of arrhythmia and class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones. For the time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a
classification. However, there are differences between the cardio log’s and the programs classification. Taking the cardio log’s as a gold standard we aim to minimize this
difference by means of machine learning tools.
